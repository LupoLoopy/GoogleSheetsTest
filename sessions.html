              <p>For the wannabe conductors amongst you... Start your (steam) engines!</p>
						</header>
						<p>Players can register to host a game of their choosing during this window. As in, as of right now!<p>
            <p>They must be able to provide a copy of the game and be prepared to teach the game to the other players. Additionally, it would helpful if they are able to bring a suitably sized poker chip bank to support the game as only a limited number of house banks will be available</p>
            <p>Hosts can complete the following form to submit to host a game during this session:</p>

							<h3>Planned Game Registration - 23rd Sep. to 11th Oct.</h3>
              <p>Coming soon!</p>
						</header>
						<p>After all event submissions have been collated, the list of available games will be published on this page. A sign-up form will be configured to allow attendees to express their interest in participating in planned sessions.</p>
            <p>Signups will be taken on a first come, first served basis and should players submit for more than one game in a given time slot, the hosts will assign the player to one of the clashing preferences at their discretion.</p>
<p>The StationedOut.info website will be periodically updated with revised player counts for advertised session. Please note that said player counts are not a live representation of session status.
<p>After the deadline for event signup has passed, players will be expected to either arrange their own games or join pre-organised sessions (if of interest), should capacity remain available.

							<h3>Clarifications & Considerations</h3>
              <p>The small print...</p>
						</header>
						<ul class="default">
              <li>Players are only eligible to host or signup for an event if they have already purchased a ticket for StationedOut.</li>
              <li>Players will not be able to host and join a game scheduled at the same time. The event hosting will be deemed to take preference in this scenario.</li>
              <li>The timings of these sessions are approximate; however the intention is to commence session 1 & 3 at the scheduled times. Sessions 2 & 4 may be impacted by long running games from the previous session.</li>
              <li>Should the event a host / players sign up for not meet the minimum player requirement, then the host and players will be free to join other already scheduled games until they meet their capacity, with agreement of the game host.</li>
              <li>Free play â€“ players are welcome to arrange games independently upon both days.</li>
              <ul class="default">
                <li>Please note there is no guarantee that enough (or willing) players will be found to allow a game to proceed.</li>
                <li>Players who are not able to arrange a game will not be able to join an already in progress scheduled game without permission from the host.</li>
              </ul>
